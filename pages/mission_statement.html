    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>
        This is Public Anomie, a microsite dedicated to whatever is currently on my mind. <br> Don't call it a blog.
    </p>
    <h3>Impermance is beautiful</h3>
    <p>
        Nothing I publish to this site will last. Each new entry is replacing the one that came before.
    </p>
    <h3>Consistency is not key</h3>
    <p>
        I will use this site to share whatever I damn well please; although I expect it to be primarily text based it
        will change based on my ever-shifting whims.

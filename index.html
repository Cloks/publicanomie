        Some Thoughts I
    </h3>
    <p> I haven't been able to read lately. I keep picking up books, making some marginal progress and putting them down
        again. I've picked up <i>Vineland</i> by Thomas Pynchon again, and judging by where I stuck the bookmark I made
        it about a third of the way through last time. It's funny and more immediately readable than his famous
        doorstoppers, requiring less of a grounding in esoterica to get started. Based on what I've read of Pynchon and
        what I understand of what I haven't read, his writing can be broadly categorized into big ol' all encompassing
        doorstoppers and detective novels, of which this falls into the latter category. People tend to recommend <i>The
            Crying of Lot 49</i> as a good starting point because it's short but I'm of the opinion that it's easier to
        start with <i>Inherent Vice</i>, which demands less of the reader. Hell, maybe it's reasonable to make demands
        of the reader, keep the riff-raff out. Knowing Pynchon though, he wants the riff-raff <b>in</b>, namely
        Californian bums. I'm also picking at Chris Hedge's <i>American Fascists</i> because I like getting less sleep.
        Look up dominionists and the seven mountain movement if you want to see where our beautiful US of A is being
        steered.</p>
    <p> The enby has been interested in oaters lately, so I've seen a few for the first time. <i>Pat Garret and Billy
            the Kid</i> is a new favorite, mostly for the score. I watched it in the redone 50th annivesary cut, which
        Criterion put together for the recent 4K release. I can't get Knockin' on Heaven's Door out of my head.
        It was the bi-annual Criterion sale lately and I left the website with a much lighter wallet and a stack of
        important classic and contemporary films, including a posse of oaters, some I expect to go out of print and some
        of personal interest. I'm looking forward to rewatching Todd Solondz's <i>Happiness</i> in an anamorphic format
        and maybe rewatching <i>Antichrist</i> without my fingers over my eyes. Speaking of media, HBOCINEMAXQUIBI is
        trying to sell off the Looney Tunes IP, which feels like some kind of heresy. I've been submitting bids on a
        character by character basis and I'm this close to getting use of Henry the Chicken Hawk and Slowpoke Rodriguez,
        not to mention Nasty Canasta.
    </p>

        I can't stop thinking about how poorly the Harris campaign was run, mostly because we live in the world
        resulting from that and I keep seeing my "allies" blaming her loss on those dang ol' transexuals wanting to be
        creepin' and peepin' in public restrooms. I think it may have been her lack of a vision that did her in, as well
        as not having some sort of clearly communicated benefit from voting for her. I have a special hatred for Third
        Way and it's funny that they're insisting the candidate who campaigned with Liz Cheney wasn't centrist enough.
        Bernie's still out there, god bless him, taking AOC along for the ride as far as I know. I see a lot of
        consternation about how we won't have a republic by the next time we vote but c'mon, with the complete corporate
        capture of both parties I'm willing to bet (but not too much, again, I spent it all on the Criterion sale) we'll
        be able to vote for the Tim Ryans and other Ohio cretins in 2020-whatever. Hell, I don't know. Some of this
        Trump stuff is getting pretty scary but I question the wisdom of anyone who is willing to publicly champion
        taking healthcare from people with mental illnesses. Some dogs bite, after all.
    </p>
    <p> That feels like enough of a ramble. I'm sure that some sort of form will emerge as I keep pounding away at the
        keys, as long as I stick with it. Once it has, I'll blow it up and we'll start again. Feels nice to have it just
        be me and raw code in a competition rather than relying on the dictates of some third party.</p>

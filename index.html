    <h3>Let's all go to the Lobby</h3>
    <p>
        I've been watching a lot of movies lately - if I was canny or cared about clickthrough rates or any of that,
        this is where I'd link to my letterboxd but we all know that's not happening. The most impactful movie out of
        the recent bunch has been <i>Until the End of the World</i>, the Wim Wenders movie that presents life in the
        distant year of 1991 and chronicles a road trip to the end of civilization. It was originally released in a
        truncated 3 hour cut but Wenders saved the working negative and the version that Criterion released is the full
        5 hours. It's definitely a long movie but it moves at a fast clip, bouncing between four continents and more
        than fifteen countries as it unspools a story of love, loss and dreams.
    </p>

        I've also rewatched <i>The Third Man</i>, a movie I've fetishized owning in the Criterion release for long
        enough that I broke down and paid the $100 asking price for. Harry Lime would be laughing all the way to the
        <s>bank</s> sewers. A much shorter film, at 101 minutes, it breaks down cleanly into a three part structure that
        manages to constantly enthrall with its twists and turns as Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) picks at the loose
        ends of the supposed death of his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Spoilers for a seventy five year old movie -
        Harry Lime faked his own death and turns out to be a much nastier person than Martins knew as a friend, giving
        one of the most famous speeches in movie history that can hopefully be viewed below.

        I'm probably going to watch Godard's <i>King Lear</i> next. The enby is also interested, which will likely make
        them the only person on Earth who's watched <i>Goodbye to Language 3D</i> and <i>King Lear</i> as their only
        Godard films. I haven't seen many more but for some reason (consooming) I keep buying them so I have quite a
        large library for when I decide to expand my knowledge. Thankfully, having a projector setup makes watching
        moviefilms at home more cinematic and enjoyable. After this I'd like to watch more of Wim Wender's road movies
        and keep working my way through the stack of Criterion films I picked up in the recent sale. So long now.

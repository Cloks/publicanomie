        Some Thoughts II
    </h3>

        I've been replaying Dark Souls III and I'm confident in saying that although the game is good, the level design
        is bad. The original Dark Souls is a masterclass in building an interconnected world, taking the player on
        journeys that unlock shortcuts leading back to familiar areas. I think this is best exemplified by the
        connection between Blighttown and Valley of the Drakes - after a long soujourn to an especially unforgiving
        corner of the map, the player is suddenly back in familiar territory. Dark Souls III is largely linear and loses
        this sense of a single world as the player is simply led down a path from one encounter to the next. This isn't
        helped by the fact that the first major area of the game - the High Wall of Lothric - is completely disconnected
        from the previous and upcoming areas, requiring a clumsy transition between them. Where Dark
        Souls III really shines is in the boss fights, giving each boss a second phase that forces the player to learn
        two different movesets to triumph.

        I've also been continually playing Balatro, which is as addictive as ever. I'm trying to get a gold seal on the
        anaglyph deck which reminds me of a piece I read on Substack about how playing video games immerses you in a
        conversation that's unintelligible and reductive. I've been reading a lot of random Substack pieces lately
        because of the infinite scroll aspect, something I miss from social media and forums. I've been off of both for
        about two years now and while it took some time to adjust to, I feel like it's better for me to not be exposed
        to the constant swirl of misinformation and deranged opinions. I don't know how much time I wasted fighting
        windmills online but it's definitely not a negligible amount.

        Wild to think it's been five years since the Covid pandemic started. In that time we've seen the public
        acceptance of mass death and disability, something that shouldn't shock me at this point. Where does this all
        end?
